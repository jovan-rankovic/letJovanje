# letJovanje
A summer vacation blog.

This site was made for my first PHP course in the summer of 2018.
Here I started learning PHP, MySQL, PDO, CRUD, Bootstrap, sessions, pagination, layout and partial system.
I also learnt how to make an admin panel, functional contact form, poll, registration, login and blog related functionalities.
I had special attention for the UX, and I used a ton of AJAX.
I didn't finish the update feature, as I was occupied with many other subjects at that moment.
